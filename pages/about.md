Hey I'm Chelsea Pincock. I have made this online portfolio as a sort of interactive CV of mine. This way, you can actually see my work and projects mentioned in my CV rather than just reading the title!

Here's a little about me and my story a CV doesn't include:

I am from Saint Anthony, Idaho. I have completed my BA in Anthropology at the University of Idaho. I am currently working on my MA in Anthropology with an emphasis in Archaeology from the University of Idaho. I have several years of experience doing artifact analysis and putting together narratives the material culture creates. I have grown to love piecing people's lives together with the data I create with the artifacts. I especially love understanding peoples' diets throughout history by studying animal bones. Zooarchaeology and foodways has been a focus of research for the last three years.

Also during my time at the University of Idaho, I have worked with the Special Collections and Archives (SPEC), and the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) on many projects over the last three years. I have created finding aids for a couple collection in SPEC during an internship and was later hired by them to digitize the Idaho Sanborn Maps, among a few other projects. I worked in the CDIL transcribing some old market ledgers from the Idaho City area during the 19th century. I have continued working on digitizing the Sanborn Maps and I was recently hired by the CDIL to help with their existing digital collections webpages and future collections by working on their new project with CollectionBuilder-GH. The same builder I used to make this website!
