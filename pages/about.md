# About Chelsea Pincock.

Hey I'm Chelsea Pincock (formerly Chelsesa Codling). I have made this online portfolio as a sort of interactive CV of mine. This way, you can actually see my work and projects mentioned in my CV rather than just reading the title!

Here's a little about me and my story a CV doesn't include:

I am from Saint Anthony, Idaho. I have completed my BA and MA in Anthropology at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. I have several years of experience doing artifact analysis and piecing together narratives the from data gathered from material culture. I especially love understanding peoples' diets throughout history by studying animal bones as products of food waste. Zooarchaeology and foodways has been a focus of research for me from 2016 to 2020.

Also during my time at the University of Idaho, I have worked with the Special Collections and Archives (SPEC), and the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) on many projects from 2017 to 2020. I have created finding aids for a couple collection in SPEC during an internship and was later hired by them to digitize the Idaho Sanborn Maps, among a few other projects. I worked in the CDIL transcribing some old market ledgers from the Idaho City area during the 19th century. In fall of 2019, I was hired by the CDIL to help with their existing digital collections webpages and future collections by working on their new project with [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/). The same builder I used to make this website!

In August of 2020, the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology (at Montana Technical University) hired me as a Library Technician in the Mining Archives and Data Preservation department. As part of my job, I digitize mining documents and maps of Montana. I am also working with the web team to help create digital collections with the digitized material that will be available to the public.
