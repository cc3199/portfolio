## Honors Program Senior Thesis

I worked on this senior thesis project through the University Honors Program. My major and department did not require a general senior thesis (a capstone class instead) but I wanted to do this honors thesis project because I was already involved in an animal bone analysis project, but I knew I could do a lot more with it and the honors program helped me achieve that.
